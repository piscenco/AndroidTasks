    <string name="large_text">Anthericum liliago is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae.
        is native to mainland Europe (not the British Isles) and Turkey, growing in dry pastures,
        stony places and open woods and flowering in early summer. In Sweden the northernmost stable
        populations grows along the rocky shores of Lake Sommen (58В° N), albeit on occasions
        it has been found as far north as Uppland. The specific epithet liliago means lily-like or lily-carrier.
        Like many plants whose common names include "lily", it is not closely related to the true lilies.
It is a vigorous herbaceous flowering perennial with tuberous roots, 90 cm high,
        with leaves narrowly linear, 40 cm. and producing racemes of 6-10 lily-like white flowers in Spring and Summer.
Best grown in well-drained soil in a sunny position, A. liliago can be propagated by seed or by division of the rootstock every 3 to 4 years.
        It is a slow starter but forms large clumps with time. The cultivar has gained the Royal Horticultural Award of Garden Merit.</string>
